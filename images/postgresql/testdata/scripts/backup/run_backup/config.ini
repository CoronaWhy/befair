[Database]
; Dataverse database access configuration
; Note that this section is REQUIRED! - 
; you must be able to access the database in order to run the backup module. 
; The database can run on a remote server; but make sure you configure the 
; host and access creds (below) correctly, and make sure Postgres is accepting 
; connections from this server address.

Host: localhost
Port: 5432
Database: dvndb
Username: dvnapp
Password: xxxxxx
BackupDatabase: backupdb

[Repository]
; This section provides configuration for accessing (reading) the files stored 
; in this Dataverse. Note that the files can be physicall stored on different 
; physical media; if you have files in your Dataverse stored via different 
; supported storage drivers - filesystem, swift, S3 - as long as access is properly
; configured here, this script should be able to back them up. 

; configuration for files stored on the filesystem
; (the filesystem needs to be accessible by the system running the backup module)

FileSystemDirectory: /usr/local/glassfish4/glassfish/domains/domain1/files

; no configuration needed here for reading files stored on AWS/S3
; (but the S3 authentication credentials need to be provided in the 
; standard ~/.aws location)

; configuration for files stored on openstack/swift:
; swift NOT SUPPORTED yet

[Backup]
; ssh configuration:
; (i.e., backup to remote storage accessible via ssh/sftp; default)

StorageType: ssh
SshHost: backup.dataverse.edu
; ssh port is optional, defaults to 22
SshPort: 22
SshUsername: backup
; (the remote server must have ssh key access configured for the user 
; specified above)
; the directory on the remote server where the files will be copied to:
BackupDirectory: /dataverse_backup

; Swift configuration:

;StorageType: swift
SwiftAuthUrl: https://something.dataverse.edu/swift/v2.0/tokens
SwiftAuthVersion: 2
SwiftUser: xxx
SwiftKey: yyy
; Note that the 'tenant' setting is only needed for Auth v.1 and 2. 
SwiftTenant: zzz
SwiftEndPoint: https://something.dataverse.edu/swift/v1
