    + Finish moving variables from .yaml to .env
	A.: after experiments found that docker-compose is not consistent with overrideds of env variables. Thus, decided to keep env section in yaml files; only shared bash variables are kept in .env
    + Test changing ports

    - Test changing passwords
	A.: there some permission errors out of the box with mounted secret volume, need more testing

    - Connect google bucket [gcsfuse(?) solution]
