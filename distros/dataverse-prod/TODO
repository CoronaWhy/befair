    + Finish moving variables from .yaml to .env
	A.: after experiments found that docker-compose is not consistent with overrideds of env variables. Thus, decided to keep env section in yaml files; only shared bash variables are kept in .env
    + Test changing ports
	A.: added $db_port to override the postgres port, works on the level of postgres container but in the dataverse container some initialisation magic prevents $POSTGRES_PORT to propogate into payara configuration and it got reset to default 5432
    - Test changing passwords
	A.: there some permission errors out of the box with mounted secret volume. Looks like currenly the env variable $db_pass is beign used everywhere and changing secred for `secrets/db/password` is not affecting anything. On the other hand remove corresponding password variable is breaking the deployment

    - Connect google bucket [gcsfuse(?) solution]
    - Test solr indexing

    - fix ${dataverse.fqdn} variable propagation to payara config. It's not even initialized with default "localhost" for some reason
    - fix dataverse initialization magic for $POSTGRES_PORT
=========

    - add minIO storage service (https://github.com/CoronaWhy/befair/issues/22)
    - connect google bucket via minIO
